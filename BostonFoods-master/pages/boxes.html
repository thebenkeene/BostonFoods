	<h1>What's in a box?</h1>
	<p>Our boxes include food to feed a family of four dinner for about one week. From fresh produce to quality meats, our products are as delicious as what you'd get at a local supermarket. Our supplier, Baldor Foods, provides restaurant-quality specialty vegetables, so you know the greens you're getting are extra tasty. We know our hard-working customers don't have a lot of time to cook. That's why we also provide specially-designed recipes that are simple to learn and require very little time to complete. We also include complete nutrition information for each item in our box. When composing our boxes, we take into account the nutrition you and your family need, the shelf-life of each product, so you get plenty of time to enjoy your box, the price, so you know you're getting the best deal, and which foods you call your favorites, so you know you'll love every bite.</p>

	<h2 style="color:gold">The Classic Box</h2>
		<p>Each Classic Box contains about 25 pounds of food including elements from both the Produce Box and Protein Box, around 5 pounds of meat and 15 pounds of produce.  We slightly modify the box each month, so that everyone gets to enjoy variety in their day to day meals. Boxes are also modified depending on what is in season and what is currently selling at the lowest price, so you know you are getting fresh food at the best price. A typical box always includes our customer-favorite chicken breast, as well as a mix of fruits, green vegetables, and root vegetables.</p>
		<p><b>May Box Contents:</b> The protein:  Five pounds of chicken breast, as always. The veggies: potatoes, onions, cucumbers, string beans, broccoli, and tomatoes. The fruit: Red delicious apples and juicy oranges.</p>
